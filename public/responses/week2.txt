Kitchin and Dodge’s (The Nature of Software, 2011) characterization of code as similar to music or speech is fascinating on two fronts: it helps illustrate the importance of code as an abstraction between man and machine and the value of viewing code as a complete system rather than lines typed on a screen, and it postulates the similarity between coding and the artistic process. The task of programming is not spontaneous, and in representing a process algorithmically, programmers are associating with that process a digital subjectivity that stems from social or political contexts, with a team aiming to achieve a common goal. The relationship between software and software, or software and people, are multifaceted and although software and its creators are viewed as passive entities in a larger goal, software is an actant (Kitchin 16) as it is placed in the world and governs how people deal with problems it was designed to solve. Software is visible in the public sphere through the technologies that it enables, however Kitchin in conjunction with Habermas outline the broad role it plays. Public opinion is massively influenced and facilitated by software; discussions of power, ownership and authorship have now moved from physical space to cyberspace; and to challenge structure is now to subvert the software underlying it. It is in this friendly spirit of subversion that I segue to Michel de Certeau and his book ‘The Practice of Everyday Life’. Walking the city provides a means of individualizing the physical space and the visible and invisible rules that govern it. The city is viewed as a space planned and constructed, and the nuances of walking the city, notably the ability to make choices about one’s route, provide a way of subverting these plans. To subvert and make choices is imperative, but in the age of Spotify-owned music and Google-owned maps, it is equally imperative to zoom out and not be fooled by the illusion of choice and power. Because after all, any flavour of Campbell’s Soup is still Campbell’s Soup.
