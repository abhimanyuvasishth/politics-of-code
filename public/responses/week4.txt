Demographic is skewed.


Modeling civil violence
Using state transitions on defined variables and characteristics of those variables to model civil unrest and the response of the central authority and a discussion of what "ripeness for revolution" mathematically entails.


Dumb people smart objects
Sims and non-traditional gamers
Simulated humans and their constructed, commodified environment and the interaction with humans.
People are dumb and objects are smart -> satisfy some score and points
Posing questions about the representation of free will
This scenario inverts an expected hierarchy, in that objects vie for ownership of Sims rather than the converse.
First instinct is to consume. The idea of producing objects and consuming objects.
Identity as a conglomeration rather than singularity and the distributed virtual self as a collection of objects and people. Sims and second life are microcosms of the networked culture that spawned it.


Rhetoric of video games
Link between debt and acquisition of commodities. The idea that gamers bring their own static ethos to a game is flawed. Ethos develops as a result of the rules of the game and in the case of a networked, multiplayer game - ethos develops through interaction and collaboration. Explore the possible gestures that can be carried out in a space only through play. ut other games use procedurality to make claims about the cultural, social, or material aspects of human experience. Some do this deliberately, while others do it inadvertently. When we talk about making
claims or arguments about things, we enter the domain of rhetoric, the field of communication that deals with persuasive speech. Procedural rhetoric is most applicable to video games, and interrogating ideology by using processes, and using this procedural rhetoric to educate ~ street-level bureaucracy.
