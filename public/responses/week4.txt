To paraphrase Jimmy Tirell, "[games and simulations] are microcosms, fractal components, of the digitized, commodified, networked culture that spawned them." In 'Dumb People, Smart Objects' Tirell poses questions about the idea of instinctively consuming objects that vie for ownership in order to satisfy some condition and score points through the interaction between simulated humans and their constructed environments in Sims. He also posits that identity is not singular but a conglomerate of these material acquisitions and that the virtual self is a distributed collection of objects. Ian Bogost, in 'Rhetoric of Video Games,' associates this acquisition of items with debt and proposes games as a means of understanding ideology through a notion of procedural rhetoric. Since these games represent the "real-world," the processes we carry out in-game should be of some significance in understanding the situation they model. Bogost argues that the idea that gamers bring their own static ethos to a game is flawed, and that ethos as a result of the rules of the game and in the case of a networked, multiplayer game, ethos develops through interaction and collaboration. The title of his piece is aptly called "rhetoric," since his principal line of argument is that games - deliberately or not - make statements about the cultural, social or material aspects of human experience through the processes that players carry out in the networked, connected environments. This information can be used to educate, and in the effective implementation of street-level bureaucracy. 'Modeling civil violence' also proposes the use of simulations and games in the shaping of public policy. In this case, the simulation used state transitions on defined actors and characteristic variables of these actors to understand how best to deal with civil unrest where a central authority seeks to suppress decentralized rebellion or communal violence between ethnic groups. The introduction to 'Games of Empire' poses 'Second Life' (a microcosm of the first) and 'America's Army' as being the two pillars of the Empire - military and the market, and presents Empire theory as a "global capitalist ascendency of the early 21st century, a system administered and policed by a consortium of competitively collaborative neoliberal states". It is in this context that the authors of 'Games of Empire' raise several leading thoughts, such as the idea of digital dissent, the skewed demographic that characterizes networked gaming, and subverting and conforming to norms in the financially and geographically growing virtual gaming space.
