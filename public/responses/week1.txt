Power has now moved online. The large physical fortresses and imposing structures that stood in city centres, although still very much functional, are no longer the only permanent containers of power. The same civil disobedience tactics, of trespass and blockage, now take place in cyberspace. An attack on an electronic level means the blocking the flow of information by manipulating large public websites as opposed to the earlier kinds of civil disobedience, which meant blocking the flow of people by barricading entrances to important buildings. My first glimpse into the world of Electronic Civil Disobedience came through a YouTube video of the Anonymous group, an entity classified as Hacktivist. That term introduces the crux of Electronic Civil Disobedience – hacking. The author argues that hacking requires hours of continuous technical education, leaving no free time for researching specific political causes, skewing hacker politics towards the vague. However, with the massive boom in popularity of web development and its related sub-fields and the ubiquity of online hacker tutorials, the political cause is primary, and the coding skills needed to realize a movement for that cause follows. Although a few isolated of ECD or political hacking have surfaced, we don’t have a clear idea what the future of this field will hold. And although governmental programs are on the lookout, “sniffing” for signs, what is even more disconcerting is what the programs cannot find out. We may be on the verge of a cyber war but what would such a war look like? Having said that, an act of Electronic Civil Disobedience is a critical assessment of a representation of power. And information restriction by an isolated cell of hackers is scary, but not as scary as total information control by governmental programs. Resistance to such a program can help expose hidden inequity or deliberate information withdrawal, and spark social change.
