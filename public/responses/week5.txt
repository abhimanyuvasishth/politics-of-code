Michel Foucault's disciplinary societies are characterized by organized distribution and the control of activities in their designated spaces. Organized distribution entails an enclosure (e.g. Trump's wall) and partitioning of individuals into their own places and places with their own individuals. However, from this partitioning emerged a need to create common functional spaces where supervision could take place but they could also be of use to the people. Furthermore, the notion of rank or class is crucial to maintaining a hierarchy of power. The second aspect that Foucault address is that of controlling activity. This is done through the clock, in more ways than one. First, the notion of the time table is enforced - people have to carry out their activities according to the time table and must always be moving from one operation to another. Some jobs like the marching of an army is strongly associated with the temporality of regularly spaced drum beats. Then, there's the association between good discipline and gesture, there's a certain posture to be maintained and a certain "right way" to interact with objects. However, as Deluze proposes in his 'Postscript on Control Societies,' Foucault's society is not in line with 21st century society and control, but is more relevant to societies between the 18th and early 20th century. He addresses how control and the idea of freedom function in a decentralized, networked world. Galloway, in 'Protocol: Control After Decentralization' shares this sentiment. Galloway believes that sovereign forms of control are outdated, and bureaucracy and protocol is the new form of governance. Whether it's the TCP/IP system or the loose-structured HTML and CSS or the ironically hierarchical DNS structure, protocols govern the most extensive networked information management system currently running today - the internet. It is in this vein that Deluze claims that the technology that gives us freedom (like the internet) is more susceptible to a degree of surveillance and monitoring that we may not necessarily expect. This sets up the context for the Guardian article about the NSA, which alludes to the notion of a struggle between privacy and security in a decentralized, networked world.
