To be popular is to appease the masses rather than a select group of experts. And in principle, open-sourced governing, as proposed in 'Efficasync' is popular, and an effective means of decentralization. The argument is that the people who make decisions also face the consequences of these results, so a self-correcting feedback loop is setup. But on a large scale, proponents of open-sourced governing need to have answers to pressing questions. For instance, different people in different regions of different countries have different ideologies. Do they fork a universally agreed-upon (if that can ever happen) set of basic governing principles and add their own custom patches to this fork? Or does each ecosystem have its own repository that contributors can view, edit and make changes to? We see an example of another popular organization in New Orleans, where crimes can be reported in real time on a crowdsourced app and be responded to by a fully-armed police force belonging to a private organization approximately 26 minutes faster than a 911 call. But the crux of this organization is in the word "private". Specifically, that a single man, Sydney Torres, owns the app and the vehicles, and is responsible for paying the salaries of the police force. As long as Torres does what is "in the best interest" of New Orleans, things flow smoothly. But the consequences of his turning rogue are tbd. But the undeniable power of popular technologies like social media are addressed by R. Srinivasan in his article 'Taking power through technology in the Arab Spring', who studies how social media infiltrates the largely controlled media elites and links the street and the digital world in that a call to action online translates to a physical movement. "What for Lenin was the newspaper could be a website for Hamalawy. And a websiteâ€™s ability to connect leaders real-time could shape the power of a movement." This physical movement, or calls to collective action are feared by the Chinese government, as the study about Reverse-engineering censorship in China shows. Criticism is tolerated, collective action is censored.
